:)
good curricula/docs
good amount of external resources provided
volunteer to student ratio was good
supportive and helpful volunteers
awesome instructors
TAs:
  TAs did good job of elaborating
  good for teachers to have backup
  multiple points of view
moving students around to accommodate everyone's needs
adaptable instructors/reading the room
CAFFEINE!!!!
good use of visuals (Jade, in the conservatory, with the whiteboard)
good pace (blue Jason)
above and beyond the curriculum when necessary/appropriate (Caleb)
good amount of social time
InstaCart space was amazingfruit

:/
learning styles/teaching styles; hard to match up
  awareness of these^ styles and ability to shift; happened, but could be streamlined?
  find a way to better match learning and teaching styles from the start?
info overload/mermorizing commands
  ^cheat sheet? (for common commands; group by type/program)
  maybe a record-keeper TA who writes important commands that will be repeated on whiteboard?
for blue classes, maybe we don't have to get to rails everytime; felt a little rushed at the end (Jane :) )
have a TA breakout area for when TAs need to go more in depth
  and if so extra TAs in blue/green classes
teachers get feedback throughout (this was good)
  maybe make ^ a more official component; write it into the curricula
students sometimes felt torn between reading the curricula and listening to the instructor
  give students quiet time to read instructions
  use reading time to guage pace
some optional prepwork at installfest for blue/green students that want a headstart
make sure ALL students are familiar with foundational terms/concepts/assumptions
descriptions of colors are super vague, hard for students to self-select properly
  maybe provide an optional short quiz to help students self-select better

:(
dietary considerations
  especially: be more clear about whether we will be able to accommodate them
more adaptable options (like middle eastern mezze platters/Chipotle so that gluten-/dairy-/meat-free options are automatically included)
encourage people to be more respectful of the space; add to ground rules
sometimes seems like there's too much chaos when TAs are helping (see TA breakout space comment above)
TA tangents require more catchup
  develop a system of stalling the class but still doing something productive
do some analysis of attendance data and find optimal number to allow in
  ^(because many people won't even join if there's aready a waitlist)
