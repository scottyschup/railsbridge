check-in a little slow (TODO: assign multiple check-iners at installfest)
some minor mismatches in orange groups
AV checks during installfest? in the a.m. before event?
Also get list of rooms/capacities; clean whiteboards

:(
ran out of stickers/name tags
superbowl (TODO: during event planning stage, check for major events nearby)
pizza/carbs (TODO: don't order pizza next time!; food council to address this recurring problem?)
make sure to give security ordered list of names
add hashes section to Ruby portion of intro curriculum

FOOD COUNCIL
- alternatives to pizza
- more salad
- snacks
- streamline, give hosts a few comprehensive plans for food provision
